# EDA
 ### i have done EDA(explorarory data analysis)
 ###On various dataset
# EDA-on-Automobile-Dataset
### Performed EDA on a Automobile Dataset.</li><li>Used Pandas and Numpy for Data Manipulation followed by Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualisation.
### starter project just to get acquainted with the libraries mentioned above
### Some of the visualisations and the corresponding insights
### 90% of the people use cars that run of gas rather than diesel
### Not a lot of people have 4 wheel drive cars
### As the weight of the car increases the mileage decrease (negative correlation,colour coded by the manufacturer of the car)

### Prices of BMW,Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are very high but Porsche offers car models in a lot pf price ranges.
### From premium pricing to pricing comparable to top models of other car manufacturers while BMW,Mercedes-Benz have only premium segment cars.
